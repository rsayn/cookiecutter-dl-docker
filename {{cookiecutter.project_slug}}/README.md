# {{cookiecutter.project_name}}

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project you need to install Docker or Nvidia-Docker.

### Build the image

An utility script can be found in `bin/build.sh`:

```bash
./bin/build.sh
```

### Run the image

If you want to use Docker (on CPU):

```bash
./bin/run-cpu.sh
```

If you want to run the container using Nvidia-Docker:

```bash
./bin/run-cuda.sh
```

Note: if you plan on using Nvidia-Docker, you should use one of the images available on the Nvidia Container Repository.

The container will start a new Jupyter Notebook server on port 8888.

Note that the {{cookiecutter.project_slug}} folder will be mounted inside the container, so any change you make to the source files or notebooks will be replicated on both systems.
